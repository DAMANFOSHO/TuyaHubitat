# TuyaSmartthings

Currently PARTIALLY functional SmartThings device handler and node.js script for TuyAPI supported devices

Requires:
codetheweb/tuyapi
   npm install codetheweb/tuyapi
   
DevID and localkey's
   see one of the links below in order to find your specific keys. I used Android ADB to find the localkey(no root required)


Node script hacked together, using DaveGut's TPLink script as a starting point.
